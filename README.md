# IntegerRingLatticeCalculator
This program calculates, for a given circle of integer radius n, how many lattice points lie on the circumference of that circle.

A lattice point is defined as a point (s, t) on the coordinate plane such that s and t are integers

It works for circles centered at (n, n) and (n + 0.5, n) for some integer n - which are equivalent to the disks centered at (0, 0) and (0.5, 0)

Feel free to use this however you want
