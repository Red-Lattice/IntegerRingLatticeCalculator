# MasserGramainConstantCalculator
The Masser-Gramain constant is a very mysterious number in math. Only 4 digits are known due to the difficulty of calculation.

This is a program that once finished is meant to calculate it. It's far from finished though.

The program is going to rely on a conjectured theory of mine that all theoretically perfect circles used to calculate it lie with their centers on (0, 0), (1/2, 0), or (1/2, 1/2).
I have no proof for this but it seems intuitively right
